Ok so I guess you are reading this cuz you wanna use my code. There are some
functions that do stuff and thats:

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    9

and this part prints out a fibonnacci sequences:

    >>> fibonnacci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
